## About

Shortify lets you automate the creation of short-form videos based on a Reddit post. It's made for content creators who want to save time on video editing and come up with captivating video ideas. Shortify was the final project we created for the end of the [LeWagon | Tokyo Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/tokyo).
